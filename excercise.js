/**
 * A Web Developer is working on a engine for a JavaScript's Web Editor which will compile the code and check for errors on a Education Platform, so students
 * can test its code and learn from their mistakes on the fly.
 * The engine will check for the correct opening and closing of brackets, parenthesis and curly braces.
 * 
 * Implement a proof of concept function 'isCodeGood(str)' which will receive a string with the closing and opening of the characters mentioned above.
 * Words and other characters are not part for the acceptance criteria. Empty strings are considered valid code, function must return tue.
 * 
 * For example:
 * Input: isCodeGood("({[]})")
 * Output: true
 * 
 * Input: isCodeGood("({[})")
 * Output: true
 *   
 * Input: isCodeGood("]")
 * Output: true
 *
